## Colour scheme

Using [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) I choose a brown and beige colour scheme, by using the same pallete each page of the quiz looks uniform and the monotone nature of using the same colour pallete brings a warm tone to the visual of the quiz.

Colours chosen:

- Sienna #A0522D
- Bisque #FFE4C4
- BurlyWood #DEB887
- SaddleBrown #8B4513
- Olive #808000


## Font

Using [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?sort=popularity&preview.text=WHAT%20IS%20YOUR%20NAME%3F&preview.text_type=custom) I chose Quicksand as it looks smooth and joyful, which fit perfectly with the colour scheme and help aid bring that warmth into the page.
