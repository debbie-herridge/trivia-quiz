# Subject based triva quiz

This simple quiz is created to test the users knowledge on specific subjects. 

There is a a choice of four subjects:
- General Knowledge
- Mythology
- History 
- Geography

It has been built using HTML, CSS and Java, therefore it is interactive and responsive to the users inputs and choices. The quiz maintains a nude tone and simple theme, with subtle hints of colour to indictate whether the user gets a question right or wrong.

## Website intentions

### To the user:

- A simple, sleek quiz to test specific subject knowledge
- To see and keep track of score throughout quiz
- Instant feedback from answer input

### To the developer:

- To use JavaScript to respond to user interaction
- To store data from the user and be able to retrieve and display when necessary
- To create general functions in which the users subject choice passes through and filters out the relavant questions

## Colour scheme

Using [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) I choose a brown and beige colour scheme, by using the same pallete each page of the quiz looks uniform and the monotone nature of using the same colour pallete brings a warm tone to the visual of the quiz. 

Instead of the standard red and green for displaying correct/incorrect answers I have used tones more inline with my chosen colour scheme. 

## Font

Using [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?sort=popularity&preview.text=WHAT%20IS%20YOUR%20NAME%3F&preview.text_type=custom) I chose Quicksand as it looks smooth and joyful, which fit perfectly with the colour scheme and help aid bring that warmth into the page.

## Future features:

With the addition of using an API to generate the questions, rather than hard coding it into a Java array, the user would be able to replay the quiz multiple times without repeat questions. This would be more beneficial as it would keep users on the site for longer.
